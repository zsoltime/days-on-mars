# Days on Mars in Pictures

> Days on Mars is a simple app to view images made by Mars rovers, built with React.js. The live preview is available on [Netlify](https://days-on-mars.netlify.com).

The idea came from Alex Ren's [repo](https://github.com/able-leopard/a-day-in-the-life-on-mars) he posted in the [Software Development Mastery group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/softwaredevelopmentmastery/permalink/721387331606773/) as his first React app.

## User Stories

- [ ] As a site visitor, I can see a list of Mars rovers on the home page, so I can search for images it made.
- [ ] As a site visitor, once I chose a rover, I can see a date picker, so I can search for images the rover made on that day.
- [ ] As a site visitor, once I chose a rover and a data, I can click on a button to display the images, so I can see them.
